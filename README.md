# RadPatterns
Codes to calculate the radiation patterns for seismic waves from a point source, following standard seismology texts.

An illustration of the code usage is in the Jupyter notebook radpatterns_demo.

Written by Jessica Hawthorne in July 2025 to analyse the dilation component of low frequency earthquakes.  The Zenodo doi is 10.5281/zenodo.15980706.
